				<h3> We experimented with different data types and variables including strings, numbers, and booleans. </h3>
				<h2> Challenges </h2>
				<p> I ran into some challenges when it came to figuring out out how much was necessary to write in the console - did I need to say var make = "Honda" every time, or could I simply write make = "Honda"?
					I also became slightly confused when writing the "document.writeln" because I wasn't fully sure what that entailed. Initially I linked the js file incorrectly, but that was easily remedied. </p>
				<h2> Results </h2>
				<p> Below is the linked JavaScript file that I created. It consists of the linked js file and the car details (make, model, year, age). </p>
