      <h1>Lab 12: Conditionals</h1>
      <h2>Challenge:</h2>
      <p> The challenge today was to create functions that work with conditionals.</p>
      <h2>Problems:</h2>
      <p>The problems that were encountered consisted of recalling some of the specifics of the string and functions, as well as how exactly the conditionals were formed.
      On their own, the buttons and event listeners were all understandble, and so (generally) was the conditional. But combining all the different aspects together required some extra effort and information I'd forgotten.
      I also ran into some trouble with the final product itself - the lab didn't do any sorting of any kind and was not functioning as it was supposed to.</p>
      <h2>Results</h2>
      <p>The results are included below</p>
