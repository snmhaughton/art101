		<p>HOWDY, I'm Noelle M-H</p>
		<p>Let's gooooooooo</p>

		<p>I was born in San Diego to two pretty cool parents and with one super cool sister (but I'm biased). I've been obsessed with the outdoors for as long as I can remember, and love hiking and camping more than most things. At Santa Cruz I'm a psychology and sociology double major with other various interests in criminal psychology, architecture/design, photography, and the environment. I don't dislike a lot of things, except for maybe blue cheese and factory farming and the sound of bagpipes. I hope to be able to travel again one day. I'd like to frolic with some cows and have a nice job and just generally be happy. </p>

<p> Here I am as a child. I didn't know anything! Bliss. </p>
