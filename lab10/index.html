  <h2> Challenge:</h2>
  <p> The challenge was to experiment with js events and forms, creating different buttons and callouts and doing input form fields. </p>
  <h2> Problems: </h2>
  <p> The problems arose with how exactly to create an input form field - it was simpler to recall how to make buttons for me, but I wasn't sure what the formatting/layout should look like for the field.
    I also wasn't sure where the div id should go, and in terms of borrowing and sorting functions in Task 2, that required quite a few refreshers. </p>
  <h2> Results: </h2>
  <p> The results are (hopefully!) included and functioning below. </p>
</div>

  <input type="text" id="user-name"> Input your name </input>
  <button id="my-button"> Submit</button>
    <div id="output"></div>
