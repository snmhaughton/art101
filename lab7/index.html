        <h2>Challenge:</h2>
        <p>This lab is concerned with function writing containing user input, as well as working on strings.</p>
        <h2>Problems:</h2>
        <p>This part (Task 1) of the lab was relatively straightforward. I struggled more when it came to later sections of the lab, regarding strings and functions. It's a bit difficult for me to remember all of the processes of sorting and organizing the functions. I was, at times, unable to recall formatting and input for functions.
        I had additional struggles when it came to linking the js to this index.html file in the lab, because I could not get the js to show up in the browser. I wasn't sure if I was doing something wrong through gitHub, or atom, or if the linking was incorrect, but it wasn't working at all. </p>
        <h2> Results:</h2>
        <p>This is my index.html file that I made within lab 7 of art101. The output is stated below. </p>
