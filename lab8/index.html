        <h1>Lab 8: Anon Functions and Callbacks</h1>
        <h2>Challenge:</h2>
        <p>Alexis and I worked on anonymous functions and callbacks.</p>
        <h2>Problems:</h2>
        <p>The problems we encountered were remembering and navigating all the functions. They were extensive and the formatting and some of the specifics of inputting them and what everything means was still slightly unclear to me. There was a lot of re-reading slides and refreshing my memory to figure things out with the functions.  </p>
        <h2>Results</h2>
        <p>The output for this lab is demonstrated to the right - in the console.</p>
