    <h1> Lab 13: Loops</h1>
    <h2> Challenge</h2>
    <p> The challenge for this lab was to experiment with loops, in combination with jquery. </p>
    <h2> Problems:</h2>
    <p> The problems for this lab started right away with the incorrect linking of the jquery and javascript file, as they didn't turn the correct colors. I also had problems with all the different aspects of loops,
      including the "if", "else", "for", and "while" statements. </p>
    <h2> Results</h2>
    <p> Results are hopefully below! </p>
