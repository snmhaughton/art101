		<h1> Lab 6: Arrays and Objects </h1>

		<h2> Challenge </h2>
		<p> The challenge was to navigate arrays and objects, using the console and atom to practice having ordered lists and other variables. </p>
		<h2> Problems </h2>
		<p> Problems occurred in trying to figure out the console, and if the elements (arrays and objects) needed to be combined or separate with their own consoles.
			Additional issues came about when outputting the lists in my lab.js, because I wasn't sure as to the exact formatting. The age portion of the object for myMainRide I was unsure of as well, but I referred to the references Wes made in the lab. </p>
		<h2> Results </h2>
		<p> This screenshot of the atom file and website in browser (locally and published through github) show the result of this lab.
			Below is the program and finalized arrays/objects. </p>
