    <p>Today's challenge is debugging and working on old code and labs.</p>
    <h2> Problems:</h2>
    <p>The problems with this lab occurred with figuring out the specific issues in the labs I had trouble with (I didn't finish them for a reason) and coming up with solutions.  </p>
    <h2>Results</h2>
    <p>The results are in the pdf for the lab. </p
