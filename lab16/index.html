    <h1>Lab 16: JSON and APIs</h1>
    <h2> Challenge</h2>
    <p>The challenge was to work with JSON and AJAX and APIs </p>
    <h2>Problems:</h2>
    <p>The main problem I encountered with this lab was that I wasn't entirely sure what I was doing. I wasn't clear on what "reading the docs" entailed, and certain aspects of AJAX, APIs, and JSON are still unclear to me.
    I'm slightly confused about endpoints and their function etc. Ultimately a lot of my help on this lab came from Alexis. </p>
    <h2>Results</h2>
    <p>The results are in the doc/below?</p>
