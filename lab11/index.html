      <p> The challenge was to experiment with libraries and jQuery, implementing a new version of js. </p>

      <h2> Problems: </h2>
      <p> The problems I ran into for this lab were regarding the event listener, because I wasn't sure how to distinguish between the three buttons (or if I should). I also wasn't entirely sure what to put for the actions for the event listeners.
      My challenge also came when doing the js - after I'd included all the pieces I believed were involved, I ended up with two buttons for each section. I think it should've just been one.</p>
