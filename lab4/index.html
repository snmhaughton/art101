	<h1>Lab 4: Pseudocoding and Problem-solving</h1>
<div>
	<h3>Challenge</h3>

		<p>
			We completed Task 1 without struggle. We chose to pseudocode instructions on how to make guacamole.
			For Task 2, at first we were unsure as to which computer task we could pseudocode but we ended up settling on creating a Go-Fish game.
			As for Task 3, we started off confused because we weren't sure if we were supposed to have Sublime downloaded but then realized the instructions meant to be applied to Atom. We completed Task 3 after tinkering with our index.html file.
			For Task 4, at first we had trouble linking the images but after further inspection we got it to show up. Other than that, everything went smoothly and got finished on time.
		</p>

	<h3>Problems</h3>

		<p>
			We didn't run into problems in this lab (other than coming up with different tasks to pseudocode) until it came time to figure out the meaning of pre and code tags within the html.
			Any additional problems came in terms of formatting Task Two's List, the Go Fish Game. We were unable to have the formatting appear in the browser as it did in the lab.js on atom. Instead, it was all bunched up together as a paragraph.
			What we did to rectify this was make every different line of the list it's own paragraph (we didn't know if we should use the ordered/unordered list for this specific one). This got rid of the lack of spacing and showed it as a list.

	<h3>Results</h3>

	<p>Task 1: Making Guacamole</p>
		<ol>
			<li> Gather ingredients. (3 avocados, 1/2 small onion, 2 Roma tomatoes, 3 tablespoons of cilantro, 1 jalapeno, 2 garlic cloves, 1 lime, 1/2 tablespoon sea salt) </li>
			<li> Gather kitchen tools needed to make the guacamole. (Cutting board, knife, one big bowl for mixing) </li>
			<li> Slice the three ripe avocados in half, remove the pit and scoop the flesh into a mixing bowl </li>
			<li> Use a fork to gently mash them to your desired level of chunky or smooth </li>
			<li> Dice the jalapeno, onions, and tomatoes to desired size (small pieces are recommended) </li>
			<li> Dice the jalapeno and cilantro into tiny pieces </li>
			<li> Cut lime in half </li>
			<li> Add the onions, tomatoes, cilantro, jalapeno pepper, garlic, lime juice and salt to the mixing bowl with the avocados and stir everything together </li>
			<li> Serve as desired </li>

	<p> Task 2: Computer Task - Go Fish Game </p>
		<p>
		<p>	// Shuffle and deal cards </p>
		<p>  //Leave rest of cards in middle of playing area </p>
		<p>    // Evaluate possibilities (which card user wants) </p>
		   <p> // Ask about certain cards (accept user input) </p>
		   <p>   // Validate user move - If they do have card, take it </p>
		   <p>   // If they do not, draw from middle pile </p>
		  <p> // Choose computer move </p>
		<p> // Test for win condition </p>
		</p>
	<p> Above is the list for creating the Go Fish game. We detailed the major outlines (high-level tasks) required to ultimately code Go Fish. </p>
