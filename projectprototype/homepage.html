    <h1>Watering the Mind</h1>
    <div id=text>
    <p>Welcome to Watering the Mind, an interactive mental health game! Choose a low-maintenance houseplant as your avatar,
    and get ready to learn about day-to-day activities that can improve your mental health. The Covid-19 pandemic has
    impacted all of our lives this year, and some of us have been spending more time at home than ever before. Feeling
    cooped up and inactive can have a negative impact on mental health, so we created a game to help!
    Watering the Mind aims to provide sustainable, everyday acts of self-care that can improve mental health.
    As a bonus, you will learn facts about your chosen houseplant on the way! Click below to begin your self-care journey.</p>
